# BattleSaber
A program designed to make it easier to coordinate tournaments for the VR rhythm game Beat Saber

## For Players
### Installation
Download the latest release build (`BattleSaber.dll`) from Releases and place it in your `Plugins` folder

### Usage
Run the game :P

## For Coordinators
### Installation
Download the latest release build (`BattleSaberUI-release.zip`) from Releases and extract it to any location

### Usage
```
- Run `BattleSaberUI.exe`
- Ask for the server address/port and enter it in the “Host IP” box
- Enter your username in the “Username” box and click Connect
- Click on the desired players’ names so that they become highlighted and then press the blue “Create Match” button
- When in the Match Room, paste the desired song link or key into the “Song URL” box
- Click “Load Song” and wait for a the song to load (If you look closely, you’ll notice the button itself is the progress bar)
- Select your desired characteristic (standard, one saber, etc.), difficulty (easy-expert+), and modifiers (no fail, faster song, etc.)
- Click the “Play Song” button
```

 **With Stream Sync (Optional)**
```
- Instead of clicking the “Play Song” button, click “Play Song (with sync),” then follow the instructions displayed on the pop-up windows as follows:
- Left click inside of the stream (where beat saber is directly visible, so no overlay pictures) of the player whose name is displayed in the pop-up window, then click Accept. Continue following these steps until all players are accounted for and the pop-ups stop
- Note: If the matches are streamed to a central channel (as for most tournaments) you will have to click on the players’ screens within the central stream. For example, matches of the Random Song Tournament were being streamed on the BeatKhana channel, so you’d have to click the screens of the players within the BeatKhana stream and not the players’ individual streams
- Note: There will be a green screen visible on stream for a short period of time while the stream delay is calculated
```

## For Hosts
### Installation
Download the latest release build (`BattleSaberCore-release-[platform].zip`) from Releases and extract it to any location

### Usage
Run `BattleSaberCore.exe` or `./BattleSaberCore`, depending on your platform :)
